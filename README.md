- 👋 Hi, I’m @Steve
- 👀 I’m interested in optimizing Web Design through Template focused tools such as WIX and expanding their functionality through custom HTML code. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics and analysis including R, SQL and visualization tools such as Tableau. The end goal is to create more integrations with WIX where I can pull in useable data from existing databases. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on WIX design projects, Business Intelligence and other Data Analytics projects. 
- 📫 You can reach out to me @ stevewestpalm@gmail.com
